# hint-py

Python (FastAPI) backend for hint. It is being built up alongside the Kotlin app, which still handles authentication:
the nginx proxy passes the user's identity to this API in headers (see `dependencies.py`).

### Prerequisites

* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for installing Python, package management
* (Optionally) [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). Should be installed by default, except on windows, where it is easiest to install it via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) `choco install make`

## Layout

```
main.py        creates the FastAPI app and includes the routers
dependencies.py shared FastAPI dependencies, e.g. who is making the request
routers/       one module per group of endpoints
tests/         pytest tests
```

## First time setup

```
make install
```

This creates the virtual environment and installs the git hooks:

- **on commit**: ruff (lint and format), ty (type check) and some file hygiene checks
- **on push**: pytest

## Day to day

| Command      | When to run it                                                                        |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make run`   | Run the API locally with auto reload. Interactive API docs are at `/docs`.            |
| `make test`  | While developing. Runs pytest with coverage (`coverage.xml` is what CI uploads).      |
| `make check` | Before pushing. Runs every commit hook over all files, plus a check that `uv.lock` is up to date. |
| `make`       | List the available commands.                                                          |

Add a dependency with `uv add <package>` (or `uv add --dev <package>` for dev tools) and commit the changed
`pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/hint-py.yml` runs on changes under `hint-py/`:

- `make check` on Ubuntu
- the tests on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows, with coverage uploaded to Codecov from Ubuntu
