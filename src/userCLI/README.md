## User CLI
For usage on first time deployment to bootstrap the app by adding some users 
to the database.

### Usage

    image=mrcide/hint-user-cli:latest
    docker run \
        -v hint_volume:/hint \
        $image <command>

or to test locally, from root of hint repository:
1. `./scripts/run-development-dependencies.sh`
1. `./scripts/test-cli.sh <command>`

This will run the pushed container for the current commit. 

You can also run `/scripts/add-test-user.sh` after dependencies are running, to add a user `test.user@example.com` with
password `password`

This happens automatically during the BuildKite build.
